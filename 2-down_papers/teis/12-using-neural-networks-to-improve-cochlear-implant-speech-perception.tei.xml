				<p>783 An increasing number of profoundly deaf patients suffering from sen-sorineural deafness are using cochlear implants as prostheses. Mter the implant, sound can be detected through the electrical stimulation of the remaining peripheral auditory nervous system. Although great progress has been achieved in this area, no useful speech recognition has been attained with either single or multiple channel cochlear implants. Coding evidence suggests that it is necessary for any implant which would effectively couple with the natural speech perception system to simulate the temporal dispersion and other phenomena found in the natural receptors, and currently not implemented in any cochlear implants. To this end, it is presented here a computational model using artificial neural networks (ANN) to incorporate the natural phenomena in the artificial cochlear. The ANN model presents a series of advantages to the implementation of such systems. First, the hardware requirements, with constraints on power, size, and processing speeds, can be taken into account together with the development of the underlining software, before the actual neural structures are totally defined. Second, the ANN model, since it is an abstraction of natural neurons, carries the necessary ingredients and is a close mapping for implementing the necessary functions. Third, some of the processing, like sorting and majority functions, could be implemented more efficiently, requiring only local decisions. Fourth, the ANN model allows function modifications through parametric modification (no software recoding), which permits a variety of fine-tuning experiments, with the opinion of the patients, to be conceived. Some of those will permit the user some freedom in system modification at real-time, allowing finer and more subjective adjustments to fit differences on the condition and operation of individual&apos;s remaining peripheral auditory system.</p>
