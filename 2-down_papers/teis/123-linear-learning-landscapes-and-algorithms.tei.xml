				<p>What follows extends some of our results of [1] on learning from examples in layered feed-forward networks of linear units. In particular we examine what happens when the ntunber of layers is large or when the connectivity between layers is local and investigate some of the properties of an autoassociative algorithm. Notation will be as in [1] where additional motivations and references can be found. It is usual to criticize linear networks because &quot;linear functions do not compute&quot; and because several layers can always be reduced to one by the proper multiplication of matrices. However this is not the point of view adopted here. It is assumed that the architecture of the network is given (and could perhaps depend on external constraints) and the purpose is to understand what happens during the learning phase, what strategies are adopted by a synaptic weights modifying algorithm, ... [see also Cottrell et al. (1988) for an example of an application and the work of Linsker (1988) on the emergence of feature detecting units in linear networks}. Consider first a two layer network with n input units, n output units and p hidden units (p &lt; n). Let (Xl, YI), ... , (XT, YT) be the set of centered input-output training patterns. The problem is then to find two matrices of weights A and B minimizing the error function E: E(A, B) = L IIYt-ABXtIl2. (1) l&lt;t&lt;T 65</p>
