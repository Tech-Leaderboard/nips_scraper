			<abstract>
				<p>The recursive teaching dimension (RTD) of a concept class C ⊆ {0, 1} n , introduced by Zilles et al. [ZLHZ11], is a complexity parameter measured by the worst-case number of labeled examples needed to learn any target concept of C in the recursive teaching model. In this paper, we study the quantitative relation between RTD and the well-known learning complexity measure VC dimension (VCD), and improve the best known upper and (worst-case) lower bounds on the recursive teaching dimension with respect to the VC dimension. Given a concept class C ⊆ {0, 1} n with VCD(C) = d, we first show that RTD(C) is at most d · 2 d+1. This is the first upper bound for RTD(C) that depends only on VCD(C), independent of the size of the concept class |C| and its domain size n. Before our work, the best known upper bound for RTD(C) is O(d2 d log log |C|), obtained by Moran et al. [MSWY15]. We remove the log log |C| factor. We also improve the lower bound on the worst-case ratio of RTD(C) to VCD(C). We present a family of classes {C k } k≥1 with VCD(C k) = 3k and RTD(C k) = 5k,</p>
