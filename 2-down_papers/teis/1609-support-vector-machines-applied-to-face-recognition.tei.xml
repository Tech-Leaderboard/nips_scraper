			<abstract>
				<p>Face recognition is a K class problem. where K is the number of known individuals; and support vector machines (SVMs) are a binary classification method. By reformulating the face recognition problem and re-interpreting the output of the SVM classifier. we developed a SVM-based face recognition algorithm. The face recognition problem is formulated as a problem in difference space. which models dissimilarities between two facial images. In difference space we formulate face recognition as a two class problem. The classes are: dissimilarities between faces of the same person. and dissimilarities between faces of different people. By modifying the interpretation of the decision surface generated by SVM. we generated a similarity metric between faces that is learned from examples of differences between faces. The SVM-based algorithm is compared with a principal component analysis (PeA) based algorithm on a difficult set of images from the FEREf database. Performance was measured for both verification and identification scenarios. The identification performance for SVM is 77-78% versus 54% for PCA. For verification. the equal error rate is 7% for SVM and 13 % for PCA.</p>
