			<abstract>
				<p>The aim of this paper is to explore the spatial organization of neural networks under Markovian assumptions, in what concerns the behaviour of individual cells and the interconnection mechanism. Space-organizational properties of neural nets are very relevant in image modeling and pattern analysis, where spatial computations on stocha-stic two-dimensional image fields are involved. As a first approach we develop a random neural network model, based upon simple probabi-listic assumptions, whose organization is studied by means of discrete event simulation. We then investigate the possibility of approXimating the random network&apos;s behaviour by using an analytical approach originating from the theory of general product-form queueing networks. The neural network is described by an open network of nodes , in which customers moving from node to node represent stimula-tions and connections between nodes are expressed in terms of suitably selected routing probabilities. We obtain the solution of the model under different disciplines affecting the time spent by a stimulation at each node visited. Results concerning the distribution of excitation in the network as a function of network topology and external stimulation arrival pattern are compared with measures obtained from the simulation and validate the approach followed.</p>
