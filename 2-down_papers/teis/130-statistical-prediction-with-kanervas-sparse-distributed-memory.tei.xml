				<p>A new viewpoint of the processing performed by Kanerva&apos;s sparse distributed memory (SDM) is presented. In conditions of near-or overcapacity , where the associative-memory behavior of the model breaks down, the processing performed by the model can be interpreted as that of a statistical predictor. Mathematical results are presented which serve as the framework for a new statistical viewpoint of sparse distributed memory and for which the standard formulation of SDM is a special case. This viewpoint suggests possible enhancements to the SDM model, including a procedure for improving the predictiveness of the system based on Holland&apos;s work with &apos;Genetic Algorithms&apos;, and a method for improving the capacity of SDM even when used as an associative memory. OVERVIEW This work is the result of studies involving two seemingly separate topics that proved to share a common framework. The fIrst topic, statistical prediction, is the task of associating extremely large perceptual state vectors with future events. The second topic, overcapacity in Kanerva&apos;s sparse distributed memory (SDM), is a study of the computation done in an SDM when presented with many more associations than its stated capacity. I propose that in conditions of overcapacity , where the associative-memory behavior of an SDM breaks down, the processing performed by the SDM can be used for statistical prediction. A mathematical study of the prediction problem suggests a variant of the standard SDM architecture. This variant not only behaves as a statistical predictor when the SDM is fIlled beyond capacity but is shown to double the capacity of an SDM when used as an associative memory.</p>
