			<abstract>
				<p>We present a method for binary on-line classification of triggered but temporally blurred events that are embedded in noisy time series in the context of on-line discrimination between left and right imaginary hand-movement. In particular the goal of the binary classification problem is to obtain the decision, as fast and as reliably as possible from the recorded EEG single trials. To provide a probabilistic decision at every time-point t the presented method gathers information from two distinct sequences of features across time. In order to incorporate decisions from prior time-points we suggest an appropriate weighting scheme, that emphasizes time instances, providing a higher discriminatory power between the instantaneous class distributions of each feature, where the discriminatory power is quantified in terms of the Bayes error of misclassification. The effectiveness of this procedure is verified by its successful application in the 3rd BCI competition. Disclosure of the data after the competition revealed this approach to be superior with single trial error rates as low as 10.7, 11.5 and 16.7% for the three different subjects under study.</p>
