			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper we develop a Bayes criterion which includes the Rissanen complexity, for inferring regular grammar models. We develop two methods for regular grammar Bayesian inference. The fIrst method is based on treating the regular grammar as a I-dimensional Markov source, and the second is based on the combinatoric characteristics of the regular grammar itself. We apply the resulting Bayes criteria to a particular example in order to show the efficiency of each method. 1 MOTIVATION We are interested in segmenting electron-microscope autoradiography (EMA) images by learning representational models for the textures found in the EMA image. In studying this problem, we have recognized that both structural and statistical features may be useful for characterizing textures. This has motivated us to study the source modeling problem for both structural sources and statistical sources. The statistical sources that we have examined are the class of one and two-dimensional Markov sources (see [Smith 1990] for a Bayesian treatment of Markov random field texture model inference), while the structural sources that we are primarily interested in here are the class of regular grammars, which are important due to the role that grammatical constraints may play in the development of structural features for texture representation.</p>
