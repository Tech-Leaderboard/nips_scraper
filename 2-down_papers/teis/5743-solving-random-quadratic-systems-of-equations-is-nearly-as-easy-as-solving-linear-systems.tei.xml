			<abstract>
				<p>This paper is concerned with finding a solution x to a quadratic system of equations y i = ||a i , x| 2 , i = 1,. .. , m. We demonstrate that it is possible to solve unstructured random quadratic systems in n variables exactly from O(n) equations in linear time, that is, in time proportional to reading the data {a i } and {y i }. This is accomplished by a novel procedure, which starting from an initial guess given by a spectral initialization procedure, attempts to minimize a nonconvex objective. The proposed algorithm distinguishes from prior approaches by reg-ularizing the initialization and descent procedures in an adaptive fashion, which discard terms bearing too much influence on the initial estimate or search directions. These careful selection rules-which effectively serve as a variance reduction scheme-provide a tighter initial guess, more robust descent directions, and thus enhanced practical performance. Further, this procedure also achieves a near-optimal statistical accuracy in the presence of noise. Empirically, we demonstrate that the computational cost of our algorithm is about four times that of solving a least-squares problem of the same size.</p>
