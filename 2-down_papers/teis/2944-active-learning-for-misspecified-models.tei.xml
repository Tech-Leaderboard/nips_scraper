				<p>Active learning is the problem in supervised learning to design the locations of training input points so that the generalization error is minimized. Existing active learning methods often assume that the model used for learning is correctly specified, i.e., the learning target function can be expressed by the model at hand. In many practical situations, however, this assumption may not be fulfilled. In this paper, we first show that the existing active learning method can be theoretically justified under slightly weaker condition: the model does not have to be correctly specified, but slightly misspecified models are also allowed. However, it turns out that the weakened condition is still restrictive in practice. To cope with this problem, we propose an alternative active learning method which can be theoretically justified for a wider class of misspecified models. Thus, the proposed method has a broader range of applications than the existing method. Numerical studies show that the proposed active learning method is robust against the misspecification of models and is thus reliable .</p>
