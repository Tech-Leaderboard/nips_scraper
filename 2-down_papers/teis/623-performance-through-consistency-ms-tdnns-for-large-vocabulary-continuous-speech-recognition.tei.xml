				<p>Connectionist Rpeech recognition systems are often handicapped by an inconsistency between training and testing criteria. This problem is addressed by the Multi-State Time Delay Neural Network (MS-TDNN), a hierarchical phonf&apos;mp and word classifier which uses DTW to modulate its connectivit.y pattern, and which is directly trained on word-level targets. The consistent use of word accuracy as a criterion during bot.h t.raining and testing leads to very high system performance, even wif II limited training dat.a. Until now, the MS-TDN N has been appli(&apos;d primarily to small vocabulary recognition and word spotting tasks. In this papf&apos;f we apply the architecture to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, and demonstrate that our MS-TDNN outperforms all ot,hf&apos;r systems that have been tested on tht&apos; eMU Conference Registration database.</p>
