				<p>This paper deals with a neural network model in which each neuron performs a threshold logic function. An important property of the model is that it always converges to a stable state when operating in a serial mode [2,5]. This property is the basis of the potential applications of the model such as associative memory devices and combinatorial optimization [3,6]. One of the motivations for use of the model for solving hard combinatorial problems is the fact that it can be implemented by optical devices and thus operate at a higher speed than conventional electronics. The main theme in this work is to investigate the power of the model for solving NP-hard problems [4,8], and to understand the relation between speed of operation and the size of a neural network. In particular, it will be shown that for any NP-hard problem the existence of a polynomial size network that solves it implies that NP=co-NP. Also, for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), even a polynomial size network that gets an â‚¬-approximate solution does not exist unless P=NP. The above results are of great practical interest, because right now it is possible to build neural networks which will operate fast but are limited in the number of neurons. 1 Background 137 The neural network model is a discrete time system that can be represented by a weighted and undirected graph. There is a weight attached to each edge of the graph and a threshold value attached to each node (neuron) of the graph.</p>
