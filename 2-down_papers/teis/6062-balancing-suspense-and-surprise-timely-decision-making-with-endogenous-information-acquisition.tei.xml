			<abstract>
				<p>We develop a Bayesian model for decision-making under time pressure with en-dogenous information acquisition. In our model, the decision-maker decides when to observe (costly) information by sampling an underlying continuous-time stochastic process (time series) that conveys information about the potential occurrence/non-occurrence of an adverse event which will terminate the decision-making process. In her attempt to predict the occurrence of the adverse event, the decision-maker follows a policy that determines when to acquire information from the time series (continuation), and when to stop acquiring information and make a final prediction (stopping). We show that the optimal policy has a &quot;rendezvous&quot; structure, i.e. a structure in which whenever a new information sample is gathered from the time series, the optimal &quot;date&quot; for acquiring the next sample becomes computable. The optimal interval between two information samples balances a trade-off between the decision maker&apos;s &quot;surprise&quot;, i.e. the drift in her posterior belief after observing new information, and &quot;suspense&quot;, i.e. the probability that the adverse event occurs in the time interval between two information samples. Moreover, we characterize the continuation and stopping regions in the decision-maker&apos;s state-space, and show that they depend not only on the decision-maker&apos;s beliefs, but also on the &quot;context&quot;, i.e. the current realization of the time series.</p>
