			<abstract>
				<p>A large class of motor control tasks requires that on each cycle the controller is told its current state and must choose an action to achieve a specified, state-dependent, goal behaviour. This paper argues that the optimization of learning rate, the number of experimental control decisions before adequate performance is obtained, and robustness is of prime importance-if necessary at the expense of computation per control cycle and memory requirement. This is motivated by the observation that a robot which requires two thousand learning steps to achieve adequate performance, or a robot which occasionally gets stuck while learning, will always be undesirable, whereas moderate computational expense can be accommodated by increasingly powerful computer hardware. It is not unreasonable to assume the existence of inexpensive 100 Mflop controllers within a few years and so even processes with control cycles in the low tens of milliseconds will have millions of machine instructions in which to make their decisions. This paper outlines a learning control scheme which aims to make effective use of such computational power.</p>
