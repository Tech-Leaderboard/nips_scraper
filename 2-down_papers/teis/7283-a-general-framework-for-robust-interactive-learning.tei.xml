			<abstract>
				<p>We propose a general framework for interactively learning models, such as (binary or non-binary) classifiers, orderings/rankings of items, or clusterings of data points. Our framework is based on a generalization of Angluin&apos;s equivalence query model and Littlestone&apos;s online learning model: in each iteration, the algorithm proposes a model, and the user either accepts it or reveals a specific mistake in the proposal. The feedback is correct only with probability p &gt; 1 2 (and adversarially incorrect with probability 1 âˆ’ p), i.e., the algorithm must be able to learn in the presence of arbitrary noise. The algorithm&apos;s goal is to learn the ground truth model using few iterations. Our general framework is based on a graph representation of the models and user feedback. To be able to learn efficiently, it is sufficient that there be a graph G whose nodes are the models, and (weighted) edges capture the user feedback, with the property that if s, s * are the proposed and target models, respectively, then any (correct) user feedback s must lie on a shortest s-s * path in G. Under this one assumption, there is a natural algorithm, reminiscent of the Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm, which will efficiently learn s * even in the presence of noise in the user&apos;s feedback. From this general result, we rederive with barely any extra effort classic results on learning of classifiers and a recent result on interactive clustering; in addition, we easily obtain new interactive learning algorithms for ordering/ranking.</p>
