				<p>A novel learning control architecture is used for navigation. A sophisticated test-bed is used to simulate a cylindrical robot with a sonar belt in a planar environment. The task is short-range homing in the presence of obstacles. The robot receives no global information and assumes no comprehensive world model. Instead the robot receives only sensory information which is inherently limited. A connectionist architecture is presented which incorporates a large amount of a priori knowledge in the form of hard-wired networks, architectural constraints, and initial weights. Instead of hard-wiring static potential fields from object models, myarchi-tecture learns sensor-based potential fields, automatically adjusting them to avoid local minima and to produce efficient homing trajectories. It does this without object models using only sensory information. This research demonstrates the use of a large modular architecture on a difficult task. 1 OVERVIEW I present a connectionist learning control architecture tailored for simulated short-range homing in the presence of obstacles. The kinematics of a cylindrical robot (shown in Figure 1) moving in a planar environment is simulated. The robot has wheels that propel it independently and simultaneously in both the x and y directions with respect to a fixed orientation. It can move up to one radius per discrete time step. The robot has a 360 degree sensor belt with 16 distance sensors and 16 grey-scale sensors evenly placed around its perimeter. These 32 values form the robot&apos;s view. Figure 2 is a display created by the navigation simulator. The bottom portion of 457</p>
