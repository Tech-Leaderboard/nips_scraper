			<abstract>
				<p>Machine learning techniques are increasingly being used to produce a wide-range of classifiers for complex real-world applications that involve nonuniform testing costs and misclassification costs. As the complexity of these applications grows, the management of resources during the learning and classification processes becomes a challenging task. In this work we introduce ACT (Anytime Cost-sensitive Trees), a novel framework for operating in such environments. ACT is an anytime algorithm that allows trading computation time for lower classification costs. It builds a tree top-down and exploits additional time resources to obtain better estimations for the utility of the different candidate splits. Using sampling techniques ACT approximates for each candidate split the cost of the subtree under it and favors the one with a minimal cost. Due to its stochastic nature ACT is expected to be able to escape local minima, into which greedy methods may be trapped. Experiments with a variety of datasets were conducted to compare the performance of ACT to that of the state of the art cost-sensitive tree learners. The results show that for most domains ACT produces trees of significantly lower costs. ACT is also shown to exhibit good anytime behavior with diminishing returns.</p>
