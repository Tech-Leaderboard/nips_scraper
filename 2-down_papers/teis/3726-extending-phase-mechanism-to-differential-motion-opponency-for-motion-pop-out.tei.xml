				<p>We extend the concept of phase tuning, a ubiquitous mechanism among sensory neurons including motion and disparity selective neurons, to the motion contrast detection. We demonstrate that the motion contrast can be detected by phase shifts between motion neuronal responses in different spatial regions. By constructing the differential motion opponency in response to motions in two different spatial regions, varying motion contrasts can be detected, where similar motion is detected by zero phase shifts and differences in motion by non-zero phase shifts. The model can exhibit either enhancement or suppression of responses by either different or similar motion in the surrounding. A primary advantage of the model is that the responses are selective to relative motion instead of absolute motion, which could model neurons found in neurophysiological experiments responsible for motion pop-out detection. 1 Introduction Motion discontinuity or motion contrast is an important cue for the pop-out of salient moving objects from contextual backgrounds. Although the neural mechanism underlying the motion pop-out detection is still unknown, the center-surround receptive field (RF) organization is considered as a physiological basis responsible for the pop-out detection. The center-surround RF structure is simple and ubiquitous in cortical cells especially in neurons processing motion and color information. Nakayama and Loomis [1] have predicted the existence of motion selective neurons with antagonistic center-surround receptive field organization in 1974. Recent physiological experiments [2][3] show that neurons with center-surround RFs have been found in both middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas related to motion processing. This antagonistic mechanism has been suggested to detect motion segmentation [4], figure/ground segregation [5] and the differentiation of object motion from ego-motion [6]. There are many related works [7]-[12] on motion pop-out detection. Some works [7]-[9] are based on spatio-temporal filtering outputs, but motion neurons are not fully interacted by either only inhibiting similar motion [7] or only enhancing opposite motion [8]. Heeger, et al. [7] proposed a center-surround operator to eliminate the response dependence upon rotational motions. But the Heeger&apos;s model only shows a complete center-surround interaction for moving directions. With respect to the surrounding speed effects, the neuronal responses are suppressed by the same speed with the center motion but not enhanced by other speeds. Similar problem existed in [8], which only modeled the suppression of neuronal responses in the classical receptive field (CRF) by similar motions in surrounding regions. Physiological experiments [10][11] show that many neurons in visual cortex are sensitive to the motion contrast rather than depend upon the absolute direction and speed of the object motion. Although pooling over motion neurons tuned to different velocities can</p>
