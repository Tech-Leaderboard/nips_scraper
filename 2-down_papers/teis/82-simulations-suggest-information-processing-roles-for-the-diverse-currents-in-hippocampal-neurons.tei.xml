				<p>A computer model of the hippocampal pyramidal cell (HPC) is described which integrates data from a variety of sources in order to develop a consistent description for this cell type. The model presently includes descriptions of eleven non-linear somatic currents of the HPC, and the electrotonic structure of the neuron is modelled with a soma/short-cable approximation. Model simulations qualitatively or quantitatively reproduce a wide range of somatic electrical behavior i~ HPCs, and demonstrate possible roles for the various currents in information processing. 1 The Computational Properties of Neurons There are several substrates for neuronal computation, including connec-tivity, synapses, morphometries of dendritic trees, linear parameters of cell membrane, as well as non-linear, time-varying membrane conductances, also referred to as currents or channels. In the classical description of neuronal function, the contribution of membrane channels is constrained to that of generating the action potential, setting firing threshold, and establishing the relationship between (steady-state) stimulus intensity and firing frequency. However, it is becoming clear that the role of these channels may be much more complex, resulting in a variety of novel &quot;computational operators&quot; that reflect the information processing occurring in the biological neural net.</p>
