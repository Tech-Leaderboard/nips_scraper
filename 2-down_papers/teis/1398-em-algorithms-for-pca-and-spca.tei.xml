				<p>I present an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for principal component analysis (PCA). The algorithm allows a few eigenvectors and eigenvalues to be extracted from large collections of high dimensional data. It is computationally very efficient in space and time. It also naturally accommodates missing infonnation. I also introduce a new variant of PC A called sensible principal component analysis (SPCA) which defines a proper density model in the data space. Learning for SPCA is also done with an EM algorithm. I report results on synthetic and real data showing that these EM algorithms correctly and efficiently find the leading eigenvectors of the covariance of datasets in a few iterations using up to hundreds of thousands of datapoints in thousands of dimensions. 1 Why EM for peA? Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique in data analysis. Its popularity comes from three important properties. First, it is the optimal (in tenns of mean squared error) linear scheme for compressing a set of high dimensional vectors into a set of lower dimensional vectors and then reconstructing. Second, the model parameters can be computed directly from the data-for example by diagonalizing the sample covariance. Third, compression and decompression are easy operations to perfonn given the model parameters-they require only matrix multiplications. Despite these attractive features however, PCA models have several shortcomings. One is that naive methods for finding the principal component directions have trouble with high dimensional data or large numbers of datapoints. Consider attempting to diagonalize the sample covariance matrix of n vectors in a space of p dimensions when n and p are several hundred or several thousand. Difficulties can arise both in the fonn of computational complexity and also data scarcity. I Even computing the sample covariance itself is very costly, requiring 0 (np2) operations. In general it is best to avoid altogether computing the sample • rowei s@cns. cal tech. edu; Computation &amp; Neural Systems, California Institute of Tech. IOn the data scarcity front, we often do not have enough data in high dimensions for the sample covariance to be of full rank and so we must be careful to employ techniques which do not require full rank matrices. On the complexity front, direct diagonalization of a symmetric matrix thousands of rows in size can be extremely costly since this operation is O(P3) for p x p inputs. Fortunately, several techniques exist for efficient matrix diagonalization when only the first few leading eigenvectors and eigerivalues are required (for example the power method [10] which is only O(p2».</p>
