				<p>We are developing a hand-printed character recognition system using a multi-layered neural net trained through backpropagation. We report on results of training nets with samples of hand-printed digits scanned off of bank checks and hand-printed letters interactively entered into a computer through a stylus digitizer. Given a large training set, and a net with sufficient capacity to achieve high performance on the training set, nets typically achieved error rates of 4-5% at a 0% reject rate and 1-2% at a 10% reject rate. The topology and capacity of the system, as measured by the number of connections in the net, have surprisingly little effect on generalization. For those developing practical pattern recognition systems, these results suggest that a large and representative training sample may be the single, most important factor in achieving high recognition accuracy. From a scientific standpoint, these results raise doubts about the relevance to backpropagation of learning models that estimate the likelihood of high generalization from estimates of capacity. Reducing capacity does have other benefits however, especially when the reduction is accomplished by using local receptive fields with shared weights. In this latter case, we find the net evolves feature detectors resembling those in visual cortex and Linsker&apos;s orientation-selective nodes. Practical interest in hand-printed character recognition is fueled by two current technology trends: one toward systems that interpret hand-printing on hardcopy documents and one toward notebook-like computers that replace the keyboard with a stylus digitizer. The stylus enables users to write and draw directly on a flat panel display. In this paper, we report on results applying multi-layered neural nets trained through backpropagation (Rumelhart, Hinton, &amp; Williams, 1986) to both cases. Developing pattern recognition systems is typically a two-stage process. First, intuition and experimentation are used to select a set of features to represent the raw input pattern. Then a variety of well-developed techniques are used to optimize the classifier system that assumes this featural representation. Most applications of backpropaga-tion learning to character recognition use the learning capabilities only for this latter</p>
