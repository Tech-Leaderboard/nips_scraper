				<p>We propose a new and efficient technique for incorporating contextual information into object classification. Most of the current techniques face the problem of exponential computation cost. In this paper, we propose a new general framework that incorporates partial context at a linear cost. This technique is applied to microscopic urinalysis image recognition, resulting in a significant improvement of recognition rate over the context free approach. This gain would have been impossible using conventional context incorporation techniques. 1 BACKGROUND: RECOGNITION IN CONTEXT There are a number of pattern recognition problem domains where the classification of an object should be based on more than simply the appearance of the object itself. In remote sensing image classification, where each pixel is part of ground cover, a pixel is more likely to be a glacier if it is in a mountainous area, than if surrounded by pixels of residential areas. In text analysis, one can expect to find certain letters occurring regularly in particular arrangement with other letters(qu, ee,est, tion, etc.). The information conveyed by the accompanying entities is referred to as contextual information. Human experts apply con-textual information in their decision making [2][ 6]. It makes sense to design techniques and algorithms to make computers aggregate and utilize a more complete set of information in their decision making the way human experts do. In pattern recognition systems, however,</p>
