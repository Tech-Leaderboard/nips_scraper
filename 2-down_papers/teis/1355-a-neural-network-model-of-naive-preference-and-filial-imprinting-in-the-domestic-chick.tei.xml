				<p>Filial imprinting in domestic chicks is of interest in psychology, biology, and computational modeling because it exemplifies simple, rapid, innately programmed learning which is biased toward learning about some objects. Hom et al. have recently discovered a naive visual preference for heads and necks which develops over the course of the first three days of life. The neurological basis of this predisposition is almost entirely unknown; that of imprinting-related learning is fairly clear. This project is the first model of the predisposition consistent with what is known about learning in imprinting. The model develops the predisposition appropriately, learns to &quot;approach&quot; a training object, and replicates one interaction between the two processes. Future work will replicate more interactions between imprinting and the predisposition in chicks, and analyze why the system works. 1 Background Filial imprinting iIi domestic chicks is of interest in psychology, biology, and computational modeling (O&apos;Reilly and Johnson, 1994; Bateson and Hom, 1994) because it exemplifies simple, rapid, innately programmed learning which is biased toward learning about some particular objects, and because it has a sensitive period in which learning is most efficient. Domestic chicks will imprint on almost anything (including boxes, chickens, and humans) which they see for enough time (Hom, 1985). Hom and his colleagues (Hom, 1985) have recently found a naive visual preference (predisposition) for heads and necks which develops over the course of the first three days of life. In particular, the birds prefer to approach objects shaped like heads and necks, even if they are the heads and necks of other species, including ducks and polecats (Hom, 1985). This preference interacts interestingly with fil-ial imprinting, or learning to recognize a parent. Chicks can sti1llearn about (and imprint</p>
